Using Convolutional Neural Networks to Classify Sound Types

## Overview
- Throguh representing audio recording as spectogram images, were able to classify audio sounds with an image based Machine Learning image  model

## Business Understanding
- Image detection is a very common use case of Machine Learning modeling. For example, self driving cars can detect what type of object is nearby or what color a traffic light is. Sound detection and classicification is less common. It is useful to have a predictive model that can interpret surrounding sounds and alert you for example of a gun shot or even a dog barking nearby.

## Data Understanding and Preperation
- The data is sourced from [UrbanSounds8K](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html) with 8,700 recording of 10 different sound classes (Dog Barking, Car Horn, Jackhammer, Street Music etc.)
- Audio recording were loaded into a Jupyter Notebook using the package Librosa and analysed
- Through a custom function, each audio file was transformed and stored locally as Mel Spectogram png image
  
  
## Modeling
- Split the data in training and testing data.
