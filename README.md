Using Convolutional Neural Networks to Classify Sound Types

## Overview
- Train a Machine Learning model that can decipher between different sounds found in an urban environment. Used a data set of 8,700 audio recordings with sounds of 10 different classes. Loaded audio and transformed to spectogram images to model with a Convolutional Neural Network.

## Business Understanding
- Image detection is a very common use case of Machine Learning modeling. For example, self driving cars can detect what type of object is nearby or what color a traffic light is. Sound detection and classicification is less common. It is useful to have a predictive model that can interpret surrounding sounds and alert you for example of a gun shot or even a dog barking nearby.
